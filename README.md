# Admissions Decisions Predictions with an ANN

Problem: there are too many applications, and the short handed administration team does not have time to review all applicants individually. 
Our goal is to develop an ANN model that will evaluate applicants based on different attributes such as occupation of parents, 
family structure, financial standing, social conditions of the family, and health of the family.
Our goal is to use ANN to adopt a model that can ideally almost perfectly classify applicants based on their attribute information.
Our output variable will be a categorical variable that describes the level of recommendation for that applicant. 
There are three levels that we intend to classify applicants: acceptance, wait-list, and rejection.
